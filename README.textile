h1. Attribute

This is a canvas animation library propelled using attributes and reusable models.

Instead of having a bunch of different "classes" this library depends on one primary function. The Sprite.

A sprite can be anything at anytime and its behavior is determined by the attributes applied to it.

A sprite's default behavior can be changed at anytime.

JSON can be used to create these object.
